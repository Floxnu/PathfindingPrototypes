# PathfindingPrototypes
Unity C# Prototype made with the goal of learning different pathfinding algorithms, current version implements Dijkstra's.

This is mostly sloppy since I wanted to test what the algorithm was capable of as well as testing some of the other things shown in
Sebastian Lague's A* pathfinding series. (https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan)
